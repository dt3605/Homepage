# Homepage

This is a personal homepage project for the CS50x course.  
The goal of this project is to create a multi-page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating Bootstrap for styling and interactivity.

## What it does
- Contains **four pages**: `index.html` (home), `about.html`, `hobbies.html`, and `contact.html`.
- Uses **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for custom styling, **JavaScript** for interactivity, and **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
- Users can navigate between pages using a responsive navigation bar.
- Interactive buttons and form validation are included to make the site dynamic.

## How to use
1. Open the terminal in your `homepage` directory.
2. Run a local web server with:

http-server
